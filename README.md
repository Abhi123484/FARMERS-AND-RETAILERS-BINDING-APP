# FARMERS-AND-RETAILERS-BINDING-APP
The Farmers and Retailers Binding Platform is a role-based web/mobile application that directly connects farmers and retailers. Farmers list crop details, while retailers search and filter products. The system acts only as an informational bridge, eliminating middlemen and improving market access, transparency, and fair pricing.
